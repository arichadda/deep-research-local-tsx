# Open Deep Research

This project is forked from [here](https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research), where I wanted to run it locally instead of using one of the external model providers. Below are the instructions to run it locally and the original `README.md` falls after the line break. 

1. Clone the following: https://github.com/arichadda/deep-research-local-tsx; https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl; and https://github.com/arichadda/vllm-startup
2. Run `docker compose -f firecrawl/docker-compose.yaml -f vllm-startup/docker-compose.yml up --build -d` from the root where all three directories are cloned. The vllm container takes a bit, so check the logs till it gives you a set of available routes, meaning it's done.
3. Then `cd deep-research-local-tsx`, edit `.env.local` with the appropriate IPs, and run `docker compose up --build -d`
4. Launch an interactive research session with `docker exec -it deep-research npm run docker` and follow the prompts from there.

You will need to create an `.env.local` file that should look something like this: 

```bash
# FIRECRAWL_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
# If you want to use your self-hosted Firecrawl, add the following below:
FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL="http://<REPLACE WITH IP ADDRESS>:3002"
FIRECRAWL_CONCURRENCY="2"

OPENAI_KEY="VLLM"
CONTEXT_SIZE="10000"

# If you want to use other OpenAI compatible API, add the following below:
OPENAI_ENDPOINT="http://<REPLACE WITH IP ADDRESS>:8000/v1"
CUSTOM_MODEL="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B"

# If you want to use fireworks.ai's DeepSeek R1 model:
# FIREWORKS_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
```

You will need to replace the `<REPLACE WITH IP ADDRESS>` tag. If you want to change the model, which is currently `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B`, you have to do it in both [vllm-startup](https://github.com/arichadda/vllm-startup) `docker-compose.yml` and the `.env.local` (they will need to be the same). The easiest way to pull in models to serve using [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is using [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). There are also some additional flags set in  [vllm-startup](https://github.com/arichadda/vllm-startup) `docker-compose.yml` that you may want to change based on your hardware configuration. Happy to answer any questions not related to the original implementations via PRs or Issues. 


---

An AI-powered research assistant that performs iterative, deep research on any topic by combining search engines, web scraping, and large language models.

The goal of this repo is to provide the simplest implementation of a deep research agent - e.g. an agent that can refine its research direction over time and deep dive into a topic. Goal is to keep the repo size at <500 LoC so it is easy to understand and build on top of.

## Features

- **Iterative Research**: Performs deep research by iteratively generating search queries, processing results, and diving deeper based on findings
- **Intelligent Query Generation**: Uses LLMs to generate targeted search queries based on research goals and previous findings
- **Depth & Breadth Control**: Configurable parameters to control how wide (breadth) and deep (depth) the research goes
- **Smart Follow-up**: Generates follow-up questions to better understand research needs
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Produces detailed markdown reports with findings and sources
- **Concurrent Processing**: Handles multiple searches and result processing in parallel for efficiency

## Requirements

- Node.js environment
- API keys for:
  - Firecrawl API (for web search and content extraction)
  - OpenAI API (for o3 mini model)

## Setup

### Node.js

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables in a `.env.local` file:

```bash
FIRECRAWL_KEY="your_firecrawl_key"
# If you want to use your self-hosted Firecrawl, add the following below:
# FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3002"

OPENAI_KEY="your_openai_key"
```

To use local LLM, comment out `OPENAI_KEY` and instead uncomment `OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and `OPENAI_MODEL`:

- Set `OPENAI_ENDPOINT` to the address of your local server (eg."http://localhost:1234/v1")
- Set `OPENAI_MODEL` to the name of the model loaded in your local server.

### Docker

1. Clone the repository
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set your API keys

3. Run `docker build -f Dockerfile`

4. Run the Docker image:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

5. Execute `npm run docker` in the docker service:

```bash
docker exec -it deep-research npm run docker
```

## Usage

Run the research assistant:

```bash
npm start
```

You'll be prompted to:

1. Enter your research query
2. Specify research breadth (recommended: 3-10, default: 4)
3. Specify research depth (recommended: 1-5, default: 2)
4. Answer follow-up questions to refine the research direction

The system will then:

1. Generate and execute search queries
2. Process and analyze search results
3. Recursively explore deeper based on findings
4. Generate a comprehensive markdown report

The final report will be saved as `report.md` or `answer.md` in your working directory, depending on which modes you selected.

### Concurrency

If you have a paid version of Firecrawl or a local version, feel free to increase the `ConcurrencyLimit` by setting the `CONCURRENCY_LIMIT` environment variable so it runs faster.

If you have a free version, you may sometimes run into rate limit errors, you can reduce the limit to 1 (but it will run a lot slower).

### DeepSeek R1

Deep research performs great on R1! We use [Fireworks](http://fireworks.ai) as the main provider for the R1 model. To use R1, simply set a Fireworks API key:

```bash
FIREWORKS_KEY="api_key"
```

The system will automatically switch over to use R1 instead of `o3-mini` when the key is detected.

### Custom endpoints and models

There are 2 other optional env vars that lets you tweak the endpoint (for other OpenAI compatible APIs like OpenRouter or Gemini) as well as the model string.

```bash
OPENAI_ENDPOINT="custom_endpoint"
CUSTOM_MODEL="custom_model"
```

## How It Works

1. **Initial Setup**

   - Takes user query and research parameters (breadth & depth)
   - Generates follow-up questions to understand research needs better

2. **Deep Research Process**

   - Generates multiple SERP queries based on research goals
   - Processes search results to extract key learnings
   - Generates follow-up research directions

3. **Recursive Exploration**

   - If depth > 0, takes new research directions and continues exploration
   - Each iteration builds on previous learnings
   - Maintains context of research goals and findings

4. **Report Generation**
   - Compiles all findings into a comprehensive markdown report
   - Includes all sources and references
   - Organizes information in a clear, readable format
